* Kendryte K210 Clock Controller

The Kendryte K210 system controller subsystem generates and supplies clock to
various controllers within the K210 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: must be "kendryte,k210-sysclk"
- #clock-cells: must be 1
- clocks: node of the base external fixed-rate oscillator
- clock-names: must be "in0"

The K210 clock controller node must be defined as a child node of the SoC
system controller ("kendryte,k210-sysctl" compatible). The register space for
the clock controller is obtained from the system controller parent node.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume. All clock identifiers can be found
in <dt-bindings/clock/k210-sysctl.h>.

Example:

	clocks {
		in0: oscillator {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <26000000>;
		};
	};

	soc {
		...

		sysctl: system-controller@50440000 {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			compatible = "kendryte,k210-sysctl",
			     	"syscon", "simple-mfd";
			reg = <0x50440000 0x1000>;
			...

			sysclk: clock-controller {
				#clock-cells = <1>;
				compatible = "kendryte,k210-sysclk";
				clocks = <&in0>;
				clock-names ="in0";
			};
		};
		...
	};
